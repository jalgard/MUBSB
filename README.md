# Description

This Python script generates Figure 1 panels A,B,C,D
for paper in Moscow University Biological Sciences Bulletin
"YEAST PROTEIN NHP6A BINDS WITH SHORT GC-RICH GENES" by
E.S. Gerasimov, N.S. Gerasimova, A.L. Kozlova, V.M. Studitsky.


# Techincal Details

You should correct hard-coded links to input files in
script's body to run this on your machine. The script uses
yeast genome and annotation that can be downloaded from 
Ensembl database (SacCer ver.R64-1-1). Also we used Nhp6A
binding intervals (.bed) from Dowell et al (supplement):
